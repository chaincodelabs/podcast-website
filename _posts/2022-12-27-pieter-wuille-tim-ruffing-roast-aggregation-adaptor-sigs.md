We continue the conversation with [Pieter Wuille](https://twitter.com/pwuille) and [Tim Ruffing](https://twitter.com/real_or_random) and Nesting, ROAST, Half-Aggregation, Adaptor Signatures, atomic swaps and more.

If you have not tuned into the first part of this conversation, we recommend listening to [that one](/2022/12/15/pieter-wuille-tim-ruffing-schnorr-musig-part1) first.
