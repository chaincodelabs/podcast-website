This is our first **Chaincode Decoded Podcast**. In this new podcast format, we'll
dive into the details of a concept we've talked about on previous shows. No
guests, no news, just Jonas and John talking about Bitcoin. A podcast _by
Bitcoin nerds for Bitcoin nerds_.

In the first episode, we talk about the UTXO set. We'd love to know what you

    (Note: He incorrectly says that 1 second for RAM access equates to "months or
    years" for disk access. Actually 4 minutes for RAM access equates to 1-9 months
    for disk access.)
