Postdoc Researcher [Clara](https://twitter.com/ClaraShik) joins Murch to discuss their block building research. They cover their [proposal](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-May/019020.html), which outlines suggested improvements to the current Bitcoin Core block building algorithm using candidate sets.

- The current `getblocktemplate` algorithm (11:35)
- Child pays for parent (13:40)
- Is there something better? (15:45)
- How easy would it be to guess the next block? (27:25)
