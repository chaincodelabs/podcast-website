For our first episode, we talked to Bitcoin Core contributor Pieter Wuille.

[Pieter](https://twitter.com/pwuille) has been a Bitcoin protocol developer and
contributor to Bitcoin Core since 2011. In that time, he's authored or
contributed to some of the most important developments, including segwit,
bech32, libsecp, HD wallets, schnorr and taproot, and many others.

We talked to Pieter about his thoughts on some of those influential PRs,
including headers-first syncing and ultraprune, and hear about the motivation
for those changes and how he thinks about them now. This is a two-parter and in
the next episode we’ll hear about libsecp and Pieter’s thoughts about Bitcoin
in 2020.
