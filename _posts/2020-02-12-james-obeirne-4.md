Next in the studio, we caught [James O'Beirne](https://twitter.com/jamesob/), who [until recently was a co-worker of ours at Chaincode](https://twitter.com/jamesob/status/1224435568840302592). We talked to James about his experience at the
Chaincode [residency](https://residency.chaincode.com/), his most recent project [Assume UTXO](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15605) ([GitHub issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15605),
[proposal](https://github.com/jamesob/assumeutxo-docs/tree/2019-04-proposal/proposal), [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoEoG6sP1hw)) and how he champions and effects change in Bitcoin Core.
