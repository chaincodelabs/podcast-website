Clara and Sergei join Murch and Jonas to talk about their [recent proposal](https://research.chaincode.com/2022/11/15/unjamming-lightning/) on mitigating jamming attacks in the Lightning Network. We talk unconditional fees, local reputation, the impact on decentralization and UX, and the state of Lightning in general.
